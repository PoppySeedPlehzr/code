    many different NCs listening.  None of which really do anything besides
    give you a rude message.  One listening NC message will direct you suggestively
    to a port that that has a different type of signature... This port will
    be listening for a password.  This is a python script that takes a username
    and password combination, and given the correct credentials it will send you a file
    that file contains the flag.
    
* (easy)
    web server listening on non-80 port.  Inside of the index.html page...
    there will be commented out a base64 encoded tar file.

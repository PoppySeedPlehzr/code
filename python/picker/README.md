# The Picker of Things!

This script is designed to select an item, from a list of items
provided at the command line.

Why write a script for something so trivial you might ask?  The motivation
for this code came from the workplace lunch disagreement!  Many-a-time have
myself and the fine folks at Handel IT been entirely unable to agree on a place
with which to spend our lunch hour, that I decided to allow a computer to
randomly select for us!

This script makes random selections from a normal distribution and
tallys these selections for a specified number of cycles.  Once a round
of selections has completed, the ravenous employees will be prompted
with the computers decision.  If there yet continues disagreement of the
selection, one can discard the result and ORDER the computer to run the simluation
again in an attempt to derive a fair selection!

Go forth and select things from lists of many things!

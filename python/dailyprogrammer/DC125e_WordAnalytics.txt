Cicero's first Oration against Catiline is sometimes used in type specimens: Quo usque 
tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet?…

Today's popular version of lorem ipsum was first created for Aldus Corporation's first 
desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker in the mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh.[1] 
Art director Laura Perry adapted older forms of the lorem text from typography samples—it 
was, for example, widely used in Letraset catalogs in the 1960s and 1970s[1] (anecdotes 
suggest that the original use of the "Lorem ipsum" text was by Letraset, which was used 
for print layouts by advertising agencies as early as the 1970s). The text was frequently 
used in PageMaker templates.

Various pieces of software, including text editors (or plug-in modules for same), can 
generate semi-random "lorem text" that often has little or nothing in common with the 
canonical variety, other than looking like (and often being) jumbled Latin. Apple's 
Pages and Keynote software use this jumbled text as a sample screenplay for their 
screenplay layout. Lorem ipsum is also featured on Joomla! and WordPress web content 
managers. Microsoft Office Word 2007, 2010 and 2013 have a Lorem ipsum feature.[4] 
"Lorem and More" is an extension for inserting "lorem text" into web pages in Adobe Dreamweaver
